Introduction
------------
This is a sudoku solving algorithm implemented in C.

These programs were recently modified to work on Linux. Some may no longer
work on windows. Specifically `timesolvesudoku` was rewritten using a
Unix-specific function.

**See [ALGORITHM.md](ALGORITHM.md) for more specific details about this Sudoku solving algorithm**

Usage
-----
### Solve Sudoku Puzzles ###
Compile the project using make:

    $ make solvesudoku

Or more simply just:

    $ make

Run it with some input:

    $ solvesudoku < input.txt

Or type in your input manually

    $ solvesudoku
    200080300
    060070084
    030500209
    000105408
    000000000
    402706000
    301007040
    720040060
    004010003

The solver expects input in the following format:

* One row per line, numbers only.
* Exactly 9 items per row.
* 0 marks an empty space.

You can pass in as many boards as you want. Separate boards must follow 
each other in the input one right after another.

Once the board is solved, it is printed to standard output.

The program ends when EOF (Ctrl+Z) is found or when an error occurs.

### Format Sudoku Puzzles ###
This simple program can be used to format the output of the solving program (or
any sudoku puzzle). Just give it any puzzle in the same format as for the solver
and it wil format it nicely.

This simply formats and prints a board:

	$ formatsudoku < input.txt
	  | A  B  C | D  E  F | G  H  I |
	---------------------------------
	1 | 4  0  0 | 0  0  0 | 8  0  5 |
	2 | 0  3  0 | 0  0  0 | 0  0  0 |
	3 | 0  0  0 | 7  0  0 | 0  0  0 |
	---------------------------------
	4 | 0  2  0 | 0  0  0 | 0  6  0 |
	5 | 0  0  0 | 0  8  0 | 4  0  0 |
	6 | 0  0  0 | 0  1  0 | 0  0  0 |
	---------------------------------
	7 | 0  0  0 | 6  0  3 | 0  7  0 |
	8 | 5  0  0 | 2  0  0 | 0  0  0 |
	9 | 1  0  4 | 0  0  0 | 0  0  0 |

This solves the board and then formats it:

	$ solvesudoku < input.txt | formatsudoku
	  | A  B  C | D  E  F | G  H  I |
	---------------------------------
	1 | 4  1  7 | 3  6  9 | 8  2  5 |
	2 | 6  3  2 | 1  5  8 | 9  4  7 |
	3 | 9  5  8 | 7  2  4 | 3  1  6 |
	---------------------------------
	4 | 8  2  5 | 4  3  7 | 1  6  9 |
	5 | 7  9  1 | 5  8  6 | 4  3  2 |
	6 | 3  4  6 | 9  1  2 | 7  5  8 |
	---------------------------------
	7 | 2  8  9 | 6  4  3 | 5  7  1 |
	8 | 5  7  3 | 2  9  1 | 6  8  4 |
	9 | 1  6  4 | 8  7  5 | 2  9  3 |

Files Summary
-------------

### Generic Code Files ###
These files are used by the executables to do their work.

* sudoku(.c/.h) - A representation of a sudoku board and all the functions
	that go with accessing/modifying it
* puzzlesolver(.c/.h) - The actual puzzle solving algorithm
* boardparser(.c/.h) - A parser for sudoku boards in the format prescribed above
* drawboard(.c/.h) - For drawing the board onto the screen in either the simple
	form (used for input) and also in the nicer format with row and column
	numbers. Boxes are also separated out visually in the second format (as
	shown above).
* inputhandler(.c/.h) - Allows you to get input from any file source (such as stdin)
	since C doesn't provide any reasonable default for that kind of stuff.

### Executable Sources ###
These files can all be compiled (using make or otherwise) into
standalone files. These files tie together the other files to
actually do something.

* formatsudoku.c - Formats sudoku puzzles so they look nice
* solvesudoku.c - Solves sudoku puzzles and outputs the solution
* timesolvesudoku.c - Solves sudoku puzzles and then outputs
	a single row for a CSV file that provides information using
	a Windows specific profiler.
